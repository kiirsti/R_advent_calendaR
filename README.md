# R_advent_calendaR
The original R advent calendaR that teaches the basics in R

-----

Thanks for your interest in the R advent calendaR!

I originally made this calendaR in 2019 for my boyfriend who was wanting to learn R. The original was hosted on my personal website as text files that could be downloaded and copy-pasted into R scripts. This year (2023), I finally got around to compiling them all into a single R Notebook file. I also made some tiny updates and changes.

If you’d like to check out the original version and the post on my website, <a href="https://kiirstio.wixsite.com/kowen/post/the-25-days-of-christmas-an-r-advent-calendar">here it is</a>

I’m by no means an expert! I made this to help myself learn while teaching others. If you find errors, please let me know and I will happily update it.

If you enjoyed the calendaR and would like to show your appreciation, please consider donating to one of the charities that I’m involved in:

<a href="http://wildresearch.ca/get-involved/donate/">WildResearch</a>

<a href="https://colchester.bigbrothersbigsisters.ca/donate/">Big Brothers Big Sisters of Colchester</a>

*** TO GET STARTED ***

1. Download the folder advent_calendaR and put it on your Desktop.
2. Open the .rmd file. This contains the entire advent calendaR (all 25 days of R!).

Then... wait for December 1st ;)
